### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*
- Describe the pitfalls of working without any established feature priority
- Align possible app features with the user goals developed during research synthesis

## Opening (5 mins)

You’ve gone through a few sprints of the UX/design thinking process: Research > Hypothesis > Prototype > Test. Now you have some insights around how to move forward, which major parts are/aren’t working. Today we’re going to talk about what’s next, beyond meeting that primary user goal.

## Introduction: Feature Prioritization (5 mins)

> Check: Why is it important to prioritize during the design process? What does all of this mean for your projects?

The objective is to help you focus on what adds value to the user’s overall experience and develop your vision.

Remember, it’s much easier to extend existing behaviors than to force people into a completely new way of doing something. Focusing on what the majority of users are trying to do is important. Don’t get distracted by people who say you have to meet every single edge case...because you don’t.

Finding a balance between business needs, user goals, and design ideas is really hard:

...and we’re trying to focus in on the goals our users are trying to accomplish most frequently.

## Guided Practice: Feature Inventory (10 mins)

Take a few minutes to split up into your project groups.
Together, think about your group project. Remember, you had to perform user interviews for your app. Think about these questions:

- Did your personas have more goals, beyond the primary user goal?
- What user goals did you decide to address? Do those goals require more functionality?

Write on Post-its all of the features you think would address these goals and align with the needs of users for your app.

## Demo: 2x2 Matrix Feature Prioritization (10 mins)

Let's talk about one method of feature prioritization, creating a 2x2 matrix that compares value and cost.  It's the most prevalent form of feature prioritization and related to scatter plot charts and SWOT analyses.

Realistically, matrix axes options may vary: effort vs impact, bang vs buck, UX value vs tech value, meets user goals vs meets biz goals, desirability vs feasibility.

The goal is to identify want things that have high value and low cost.

## Group Practice: Creating a 2x2 Matrix for Project 3 (30 mins)

With your group, you'll take the next 30 minutes and practice creating a 2x2 matrix to prioritize the list of features you've decided on for your group project.
If you think of additional features beyond those you came up with earlier, add them now.

Draw out a 2x2 matrix on the wall or table, and decide where in the matrix each post-it belongs.
This is a good time to remove duplicate post-its or combine similar post-its into one.

It's very important that the team discuss and reach a consensus on the value and difficulty of each feature - you should all be able to explain why each feature should go where you put it in the matrix!
You should refer to your problem statement, user personas to help you decide the value of each feature.

Remember that you may not end up implementing _ALL_ these features. Ordering them in terms of priority is the next step.
For now, just focus on the value vs. difficulty of each feature so that you have a basis for deciding priority later.

**Be sure to document your matrix by taking a photo!**

## Group Practice: Prioritize Your Project 3 Features (20 minutes)

In your groups, prioritize features for your project groups.
In this context, _priority_ refers to **the order in which you will implement the features.**
Once you complete the prioritization, stick to it! It doesn't make any sense to work on a low-priority feature before a high-priority feature is done.

Some suggestions:
- At the top of your priority list should be any high-value, low-difficulty features.
- After that, you need to make some tough calls for the ordering of high-value, high-difficulty features. There may be an idea that’s an outlier that is so worth it to your users that it’s worth the effort.
- After that will likely be the low-value but low-difficulty features.
- Lastly, any low-value, high-difficulty features should be at the BOTTOM of your list. If you run out of time before getting to these, that shouldn't be a problem.

**Be sure to document your priority list by taking a photo or typing it up!**

## Conclusion (5 mins)

In the next lab, you will combine your research with your prioritized feature list to craft a pitch that explains your vision for your app.

After that, you can combine your prioritized feature list with the techniques we've discussed previously to form a roadmap for how your team will do its work:
- Work on the features in order of priority
- Divide up the work by feature. Everyone should be able to say exactly what feature they're working on at any given time!
- For each feature, write conditional statements that must be true for the feature to be considered complete
- Write user stories for each condition
- Determine how each user story will be tested (combination of unit tests, Espresso tests, and manual tests)
- Finally, write code and refine it until all tests pass
