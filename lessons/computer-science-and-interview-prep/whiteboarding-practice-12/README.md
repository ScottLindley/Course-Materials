## Exercise

Team up in groups of 2 or 3 and take turns working on the following problems. Pretend you are in an interview setting:
- Keep talking!
- Ask questions (to the instructors, or to your teammates)
- Consider starting with an example, showing the expected outputs for sample inputs
- Consider writing pseudocode before Java to make your steps clear to both you and the interviewer

#### Requirements

Take turns working through these problems on the whiteboard. It's OK if you don't finish them all. Make as much progress as you can.

1. Write a method to reverse an array and calculate the Big O for your algorithm. You can't use the built in reverse method for Java!

2. Find the first non-repeated character in an array of characters and calculate the Big O for your algorithm.

3. An array is supposed to contain the numbers 1-100 in order, but one number is missing. Write a method to find the missing number and calculate its Big O.

4. Given two arrays of integers which are identical except for a single element, write a method to find which number is different in the second array. Find your algorithm's Big O.

5. Write a method that finds the second highest number in an unsorted array of integers. Calculate the Big O of your algorithm.

#### Deliverable

No deliverable - just practice working through problems out loud on a whiteboard
