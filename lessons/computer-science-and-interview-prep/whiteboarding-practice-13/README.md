## Exercise

Team up in groups of 2 or 3 and take turns working on the following problems. Pretend you are in an interview setting:
- Keep talking!
- Ask questions (to the instructors, or to your teammates)
- Consider starting with an example, showing the expected outputs for sample inputs
- Consider writing pseudocode before Java to make your steps clear to both you and the interviewer

#### Requirements

Take turns working through these problems on the whiteboard. It's OK if you don't finish them all. Make as much progress as you can.

Describe the classes and screens needed to create:

* A shirt-selling app
* A to-do list app
* A dating app
* An email app
* A banking app

_Note: This is not a java exercise. Describe what data and methods the classes need, but do not write the Java code for it._

Describe how the screens are connected, and what happens in between (i.e. what data is being passed, what calls are being made, etc.)

Keep the data in mind. Assume that the data is coming from a remote server via API calls.

#### Deliverable

No deliverable - just practice working through problems out loud on a whiteboard
